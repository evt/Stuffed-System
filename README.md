Stuffed System
==============

Legendary (or so we would like to think) Perl framework for web applications. It uses both object
oriented and functional code, depending on the situation, and doesn't limit developers to only 
one of these approaches. Features skins support, templates compilation for faster processing, 
plugins, built-in internationalization, full mod_perl compatibility.

In development since 2002, currently at version 4.0.

[Stuffed Sync](https://github.com/eych/Stuffed-Sync) is an example of a real web application built
on top of Stuffed System.
