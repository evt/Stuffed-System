# Event: start

# Event is called right after the system package finished initializing (for 
# example, just before the call to $system->pkg('system') is returned to the 
# caller).

# This event exists in all packages, but due to the special nature of
# the system package, the event in the system package can be considered a
# global 'system start' event as well.
